## Exercises

Exercise numbers are from the Lebl textbook.

1.  Read: <http://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/History_Math/math-read.htm>.  
    
    1.  What is one interesting or surprising idea you learned from this reading?
    2.  What is one idea you will use when you read mathematics?

2.  3.3.14

3.  One of 3.4.5 or 3.4.7

4.  4.1.11 (this exercise shows for example that $$\sin(1/x) x^2$$ is differentiable)

5.  4.2.12



## Instructions

If you don't have LaTeX on your computer, you can use [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).
Upload the PDF to Gradescope.
Don't submit the LaTeX source, just the PDF.

+ When you upload to Gradescope,
  please mark which page of the PDF has your answer to each question!

Email your instructor (that's me) if you have questions or need help.

Please include your name and the homework number
(this is Homework 1) within the document.
Some additional formatting instructions are in the
[syllabus]({{ "/syllabus" | relative_url }}).
To summarize:

+ Use a new page (`\newpage`) for each problem.
+ State which question you are answering and the actual question.
  Then, start your answer in a new paragraph.
+ Use environments such as `proof` and `theorem`
  (via `\begin{proof}...\end{proof}`).
+ Use 12pt option `\documentclass[12pt]{amsart}` and `\linespread{2.4}`.

Please find and use the LaTeX template linked on the course website.

You are encouraged to work together on the homework!

+ Visit the Mathematics Colloquium web page: <https://math.boisestate.edu/colloquium/>  
  Visit the Mathematics seminars web page: <https://math.boisestate.edu/seminars/>  
  You are invited to attend colloquium and seminar talks!

+ You might be interested in this paper about writing proofs:  
  <https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/w10/writingman.pdf>  
  But, warning, it's pretty long, 17 pages. You might want to read a little bit at a time.
