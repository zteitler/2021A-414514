## Email submission

Send your final term paper by email.

## Sharing

Please let me know if you would be willing to share your final term paper with others.
That could be other students in the class, or even letting your term paper be posted
on the course website, for the internet to see.
This is very optional!
You do not have to share your final term paper,
and even if you agree to share it,
it's fine if you want to limit sharing to be only with the class.
