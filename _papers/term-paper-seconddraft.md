Write a second draft of your term paper.

## Purpose

This draft has the following three purposes:

1.  Have an opportunity for feedback and suggestions.
    This includes sharing your draft paper with other students
    in the class for peer feedback and sharing ideas.

2.  Making sure you stay on schedule to finish a term paper
    without a big rush at the end of the semester.

3.  Incorporate a bibliography with proper formatting.


## Requirements

Given the realities of an academic semester,
your term paper first draft is allowed to be
an _incomplete draft_.
Here is what is required:

1.  Your paper should have a title and identifiable topic/theme.

2.  Every section of the paper should be _present_
    (should at minimum be marked with a section title using `\section{...}`),
    and almost all sections should be _nearly complete_.
   
    (That doesn't mean they have to be in final, polished form.
    There can still be some things left to work on, some gaps, and so on.)

3.  Include at least one theorem statement and at least one proof
    (a complete, "main" proof).


4.  Include a bibliography with at least one reference
    (ideally, at least three)
    and with proper formatting.
    
    See
    ["How to Bibliography"](https://zteitler.github.io/assets/how-to-bibliography.pdf)
    for my recommendations of how to create a bibliography in LaTeX.
    These are not requirements;
    but if you choose to not follow the recommendations,
    then you are responsible for creating proper formatting.


5.  Use LaTeX to produce a PDF with reasonable formatting,
    similar to homework.
   
    + _Readability_: Please use reasonable margins (at least 1 inch),
      a 12-point option such as `\documentclass[12pt]]{amsart}`,
      and `\linespread{2.4}` to produce something like double-spaced lines.
   
    + _LaTeX Environments_: Please use LaTeX environments such as
      `\begin{theorem}...\end{theorem}`, `proof`, etc.
      See for example [Overleaf's tutorial on theorems and proofs](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/theorems_and_proofs).
    
    + _LaTeX Sections_: Please use LaTeX commands `\section{...}` and `\subsection{...}`
      (for example `section{Introduction}`, `subsection{Short Biography of Cauchy}`).
      A table of contents is probably not needed for papers less than 40 pages long.

## Gradescope

Please upload your PDF to Gradescope.

## Sharing

A Google Drive shared folder will be created with your PDFs from Gradescope
(just your draft paper, not any feedback/comments or grades),
to share with the class.

You will be assigned two other students in the class to read their term papers
and give them feedback and suggestions.
The reading assignments are TBA.

You will be welcome to look at and/or study draft papers from other students
in the class, and you would be allowed to share feedback and suggestions,
but it's not required.



## Advice

Please review the advice from the first draft assignment! It still applies.
